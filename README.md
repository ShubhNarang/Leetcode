# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of **LeetCode problems**. Each problem is stored in its own directory to keep things organized and easy to navigate.

Each problem folder includes:
- A `README.md` file describing the problem
- A Python file (`solution.py`) with my solution

## Repository Structure

```
LeetCode-Practice/
├── Problem-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.py
├── Problem-2/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.py
├── Problem-N/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.py
```

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the problem you want to review.
2. Read the problem statement in the `README.md`.
3. Check the implementation in `solution.py`.

These solutions are intended for **learning and reference purposes**. Try solving the problems on your own before looking at the answers.
